overall hadoop/spark/aws emr admin , os, networking troubleshotting questions

1)input file has 200 mb, and block size is 128mb then number of splits and no of mappers
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17727468/hadoop-input-split-size-vs-block-size
2)command to check blockreport
https://hadoop.apache.org/docs/current/hadoop-project-dist/hadoop-hdfs/HDFSCommands.html
hadoop fsck /files -blocks
or 
hdfs fsck <path> -files -blocks
3)command to check disk space utilization
https://www.informit.com/articles/article.aspx?p=2755708&seqNum=4
hdfs dfs -usage
hdfs dfs -df -h
hdfs dfs -du

4)input file has 2 lines each line has 100 mb data then no of splits and mappers
5)how can we change replication factor of a hdfs file
hadoop fs -setrep -w 3 file1	Set the replication factor for file1 to 3
6)how can we set number of mapper and reducer in hadoop
7)what all optimization technique available in hive
8)and why bucketing , where should we go for bucketing ?
9)in hbase command to take backup of a table apart from snapshot?
hbase backup create {{ full | incremental } {backup_root_path} {[tables] | [-set backup_set_name]}} [[-silent] | [-w number_of_workers] | [-b bandwidth_per_worker]]
hbase backup create full hdfs://host5:399/data/backup SALES2,SALES3 -w 3
10)in hbase when memstore gets flush out ?
11)IOSTAT and BMSTAT ?

Destination host or IP is mandatory parameter to use this utility

17)what happens when spark submit command runs ?

19)if an spark application id is given then how to check that application is running in cluster or client mode ?
20)how does yarn helps in running jobs or application ?
21)what does catalyst optimizer does in spark ?
22)how stages gets divided in spark ?
23) if an client application is running on single executor but still multiple else executors are present and if there code is written in optimized format then how can u suggest to balance loads (repartition or coleasc)
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/29940711/apache-spark-setting-executor-instances-does-not-change-the-executors
24)in hive which file format u will suggest for optimization ?
25) if running a gunzip file operation in mapreduce then is it performance degradation or not ?
26)how can u decide number of buckets and what column on timestamp or on time like hour minute and hour ?
27)in spark how to set number of partitionspertasks?
28) how to check different tasks under which container in driver in spark application ?
29)command to listen remort port or ip listening ? (telnet command )
